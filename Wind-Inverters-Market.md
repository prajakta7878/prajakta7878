According to the Global Wind Report 2023 released by the Global Wind Energy Council, by 2024, the newly installed capacity of global onshore wind power will exceed 100GW for the first time; by 2025, the newly installed capacity of global offshore wind power will also reach 25GW. In the next five years, the newly added grid-connected capacity of wind power will reach 680GW. The report also shows that the United States and Europe may experience a supply bottleneck of wind turbines and components in 2025. It recommends that national policymakers take immediate action to increase investment in supply chains to meet their rapid growth in demand and avoid supply chain bottlenecks hindering the development of wind power. In addition, according to Wood Mackenzie statistics, China is the largest and fastest-growing market for wind power generation in the world, accounting for more than half of the market share. Data from the National Energy Administration of China also shows that China's installed wind power capacity ranks first in the world, with a capacity of nearly 400 million kilowatts.
