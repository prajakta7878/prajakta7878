Feed Prebiotics Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029
Prebiotics in Animal Feed has been shown to benefit digestion, animal performance and the immune system. The microbe population of the rumen must be healthy and in appropriate numbers/balance for proper digestion of feed, and health of the animal.



Prebiotics are fibers which cannot be absorbed or broken down by the body and therefore serve as a great food source for probiotics, in particular the Bifidobacteria genus, to increase in numbers. Prebiotics by nature do not stimulate the growth of bad bacteria or other pathogens; the official definition of prebiotics is: "non-digestible food ingredients that beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of one or a limited number of bacteria in the colon, which can improve host health."
